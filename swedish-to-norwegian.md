# Flammie's Swedish to Norwegian translator

I learnt Finland's Swedish in school but work daily with Norwegian these days,
in general of course my Swedish wasn't too good but here's how I translate.

| Swedish | Norwegian bokmål |
| :------ | :--------------- |
| minner | husker |
| pratar | snakker |
| ätar | spiser |
| jag | jeg |
| mycket | mye |
| ... | veldig |
| översätning | øversettelse |
| -ing | -else |
