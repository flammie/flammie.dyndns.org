# Flammie.github.io / flammie.dyndns.org

These pages (on github.io) and server (dyndns.org) are here mainly for me to
practice my skills. The source code of this page is on
[my github pages repo](http://github.com/flammie/flammie.github.io).
The web-pages are worked in modern github pages environment, plus simple
automake tools for the non-gh-pages version, no content managements or other
non-sense needed. The stuff kept in the pages has been changing throughout the
years, from blog posts to scripts and programming tricks, project sites, web
demos and all sorts of rants on things and stuff (the kind that isn't well
suited for facebook, twitter or other social sites, some actually pre-dating
facey book and even myspace).

The web site is structured in directories, tags or such (under construction):

- [configurations](asetuksia/)
- [scripts](skriptej√§/)
- old stuff
- [blogs](plokeja/)
- contact
- linguistics
- [images](kuvia/)
- etc.
