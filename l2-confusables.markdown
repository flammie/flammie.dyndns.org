# Flammie on L2 confusables

As an *mobile* academic who has to move every few years and learn new languages,
I have quite a bit of experience of being partially fluent in languages while
still having problems with basics, it's a weird quantum state you learn to live
in as a *L2* speaker of ten different languages. I have noted here some
curiously common confusions in every language I learn, or maybe just the
Indo-European ones but in any case.
