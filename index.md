# Flammie.dyndns.org

I maintain this server mainly to practice my skills in server stuff and web
technologues. The source code of this page is in [my github site](http://github.com/flammie/flammie.dyndns.org). 
This is very barebones no nonsense web page handling system, no fancy content
management required, just a pile of various text formats and bit of autotools
scripts. Contents have been varying through the years, from blog posts to
scripts and programming tricks, project sites, web demos and all sorts of rants
on things and stuff (the kind that isn't well suited for facebook, twitter or
other social sites)

The web site is structured in directories, tags or such (under construction):

- [configurations](asetuksia/)
- [scripts](skriptej√§/)
- old stuff
- [blogs](plokeja/)
- contact
- linguistics
- [images](kuvia/)
- etc.
