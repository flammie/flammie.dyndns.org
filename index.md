# Flammie.github.io

This is a personal github pages site for [Flammie on
github](https://github.com/flammie).

For the following github projects I also have gh-pages branches:

* [Open morphology of Finnish](omorfi/)
* [Research papers](purplemonkeydishwasher/) (academic papers’ tex files, bib files and a CV / publication list)
* [Flammie’s Dotfiles](dotfiles/) (it is, the configuration files)

The [Apertium](//apertium.github.io)-based projects are now under apertium
github pages:

* [Apertium Finnish dictionary (derived from omorfi)](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin/)
* [Apertium Finnish–English resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-deu/)
* [Apertium Finnish–German resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-eng/)

Maybe also check [flammie.dyndns.org archives](archive/index.html), some of the
pages I written in the early years of the internet, some found from the internet
archive some actually just saved over the years. This is like my old blogs and
"home pages".

Some more pages:

* [Finnish software translation notes](finnish-translator-notes.html)

* Feel free to mix and match my names and nicks but I do respond to Flammie more likely than Tommi in spoken communication due to the simple fact that the latter is like the most common name in Finland and I learnt to ignore it quite early on.
* Native Finnish pronunciations are ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet))  [flamːie] and [tomːi] but can anglicise freely, e.g. [fleɪmɪ] and [tʰɒmi] are perfectly acceptable. I'm afraid the surname is not easily understandable in foreign accent, if you need it in some occasion try [pirinen] (yeah Finnish orthography is relatively modern and phonemic, and matches the IPA transcription quite well)

### Contact information / social media

When contacting, I do prefer methods that are earlier in below table, e.g.
E-mail rather than telephone. Some of the protocols are maybe not used anymore,
instant messengers and Google+ perhaps are rather extinct.

### Calendar

I've been trying to organize my time with following google calendar (note that
it contains both calendar markings from my phone (red?) as well as all Facebook
invites (green?), the green ones are not necessarily accurate)
