# Flammie on: Zeros in linguistics and NLP

Saying that things can be represented as invisible things in linguistics is very
hard problem for computational processing of the language. From zero derivations
to elision...

One obvious use case for zeros in syntax is with conjunctions, *He runs and
swims* linguists tend to mark as *He runs and 0 swims* where 0 marks that he is
elided there but it is not always clear why, after all most languages have same
elision. Here are some counter examples from machine translation that can make
use of the zero'd things: *Brunosten er halvfast og har smaksnyanser* (Brown
cheese is half-hard and has flavours), because translating it to Finnish
requires repeating the subject as *to have* can only be translated into
habitative copular structure by turning the subject owner into an adessive
argument: "Brunost on puolikova ja sill√§ on makuja", where 0 can be translated
into a pronoun that just stands in to get the allative in.
