# Flammie A Pirinen

It was the internet of 1990s when home pages were a thing to have. A home
page would have been a html page like this, with some relatively random
information of the person. The home page was given to people then in
the signature of electronic mails for further details. In 2000s this concept
has been replaced by social media, myspace was the first back in the days,
nowadays facebook is more common.

My nick name is Flammie and it is preferred over the birth name unless
otherwise is required.

You can contact me by [email](mailto:flammie@iki.fi), 
[IRC](irc:Freenode), or using the social media as necessary
