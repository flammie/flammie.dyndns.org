# Flammie.github.io

*My main project is [omorfi](//flammie.github.io/omorfi/), maybe you are 
 looking for that. It is in its own sub-directory since the way github
 organises things.*

These pages (on github.io) and server (on VPS) are here mainly for me to
practice my skills. The source code of this page is on
[my github pages repo](http://github.com/flammie/flammie.github.io).
The web-pages are worked in modern github pages environment, plus simple
automake tools for the non-gh-pages version, no content managements or other
non-sense needed. The stuff kept in the pages has been changing throughout the
years, from blog posts to scripts and programming tricks, project sites, web
demos and all sorts of rants on things and stuff (the kind that isn't well
suited for facebook, twitter or other social sites, some actually pre-dating
facey book and even myspace).

The categories of this site are horribly arbitrary

- [configurations](asetuksia/index.html)
- [scripts](skriptej√§/index.html)
- [blogs](plokeja/indeksi.html)
- [projects](projekteja/index.html)
- [images](kuvia/index.html)
- etc.
