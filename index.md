# Flammie.github.io

This is a personal github pages site for [Flammie on
github](https://github.com/flammie).

For the following github projects I also have gh-pages branches:

* [Open morphology of Finnish](omorfi/)
* [Research papers](purplemonkeydishwasher/) (academic papers’ tex files, bib
  files and a CV / publication list)
* [Flammie’s Dotfiles](dotfiles/) (it is, the configuration files)

The [Apertium](//apertium.github.io)-based projects are now under apertium
github pages:

* [Apertium Finnish dictionary (derived from
  omorfi)](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin/)
* [Apertium Finnish–English resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-deu/)
* [Apertium Finnish–German resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-eng/)
* [Apertium Finnish–Norwegian resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-nor/)

Here is also a section for [essays, rants and such writeups](rants.html), where
I write things that are not quite well-formulated enough for academic short
papers even but longer than tweets, you could call them blog posts but they kind
of lack the temporal concept of blog postings somehow...

## Flammie

* Academic, professional details are in [my cv](purplemonkeydishwasher/cv.html).

* Feel free to mix and match my names and nicks but I do respond to Flammie more
  likely than Tommi in spoken communication due to the simple fact that the
  latter is like the most common name in Finland and I learnt to ignore it quite
  early on.
* Native Finnish pronunciations are
  ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet))
  [flamːie] and [tomːi] but can anglicise freely, e.g. [fleɪmɪ] and [tʰɒmɪ] are
  perfectly acceptable. I'm afraid the surname is not easily understandable in
  foreign accent, if you need it in some occasion try [pirinen] (yeah Finnish
  orthography is relatively modern and phonemic, and matches the IPA
  transcription quite well)

*NB:* the mail address @uit.no is redirected, because our university uses
*Microsoft Exchange Office 365 mail* with *2FA* (two *factor* authentication,
but other interpretations are possible) that only works with *Microsoft Windows*
version of *Microsoft Outlook* which I **never** have access to. The mail sent
to my gmail address gets redirected to spam folder, in my main inbox, it is
mainly used by Google apps that do not work with non-gmail addresses.

### Calendar

If you need to schedule things with me, check [my google
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZmZmbGFtbWllQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ).

### Other people with same name

There are other people on the internet with the same names, since Finnish name
laws ensure very limited set of names for people (2021 and counting). Following
internet people *are not me*, lol:
