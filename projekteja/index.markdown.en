# Projects

This folder contains software project pages and notes, for things I'm
involved with. Most of the projects have their official home pages on
[my github](http://github.com/flammie/), while some of the projects
are part of larger things such that I want to have specific notes here.
Also, Iâ€™ve written a lot about the ideas and backgrounds in blog rant-y
kind of way. Some pages also hae API docs and such.
