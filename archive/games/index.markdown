# Games

Humm, for starters, this section will contain my game projects and
translations.


## Translations

I occasionally translate random games I like to obscene languages like
Finnish just for my own fun. Here are some of those, as well as some
diary-like description of whole process, which usually does contain lots of
technical info that you might use as well.


- [Finnish translation of Super Mario Brothers 1](smb1-fi.html) was
  probably the first game I ever translated. If I'm not mistaken it actually
  dates back to year 2000, when I was in the upper grades of Finnish elementary
  school (ie 16 years old and obligatory school).
- [Finnish translation of the Legend of Zelda](zelda1-fi.html) was
  first actual translation project of mine. It turned out quite a challenging
  task and I still haven't finished with tweaking it...
