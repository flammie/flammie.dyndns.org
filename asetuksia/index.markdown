# Settings and dotfiles

This folder contains notes from times when I've spent some while setting up odd
software and had to do bit digging from the internet to find usable settings,
or even write ones from the scratch. The settings are also available in [my
dotfiles repository](http://www.github.com/flammie/dotfiles/). The
descriptions are:

* [i3 setup for volume and brighntess](i3-brightness-audio.html)
* [python 2 distutils for local installation](python-2-distutils-cfg.html)
* [Getting natural scroll for touchpad without DE stuff](xorg-natural-scroll.html)
* [SSH through another ssh server](ssh-gateway.html)
