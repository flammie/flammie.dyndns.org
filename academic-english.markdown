# Flammie on academic English

*WIP*

*Academic English* is an idea that there is very specific style of English that
is appropriate for all the academic writing. It still has a lot of support in
academic community: Universities have courses on academic English, some very
prominent academics are supporting it strongly, etc., etc. It only has one
problem. Itâ€™s an elitistic shibboleth, a code that you will be native in if you
have grown up and/or been educated in larger more expensive Western schools. It
has nothing to do with readability or any measurable good style. And it is very
strongly used to keep non-native English speakers out, especially minorities and
underrepresented peoples.
