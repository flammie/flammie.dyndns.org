# Flammie.github.io

Following github projects I have also have gh-pages branches:

* [omorfi](omorfi/)


Maybe also check [flammie.dyndns.org archives](archive/index.html), some of the
pages I written in the early years of the internet, some found from the internet
archive some actually just saved over the years.
