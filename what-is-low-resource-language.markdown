# Low-Resource Languages in Natural Language Processing
an informal survey into meanings of the word 'low-resource' in context of NLP.

There's been a few twitter and after-the-conference-beer-session debates about
what low-resource means in our field, the definitions seem to vary greatly. I
started this page to collect some citations tongue-in-cheek. The variance is of
course caused by where you come from, if you only used to creating neural models
of English with terabytes of data then it is understandable that you call few
gigabytes low amount of resources.

This is not a scientific meta-study, I just make notes to self while reading
papers that I see on twitter and at conferences. No offence is intended to
authors of the papers.

  reference to languages is probably "SIGMORPHON shared task" so it's kind of ok
  to leave langauges out in that context?)
