# Morphologically complex languages in natural language processing
an informal survey into meanings of the 'morphological complexity' in the
context of NLP.

This is a pet peeve of mine and a parallel of [What is a low resource language
in NLP](what-is-low-resource-language.html) page I wrote earlier. In practice, I
collect citations of scientists who write about morphological complexity in NLP.

Shortly put, morphological complexity is a scale that ranges from nearly no
productive morphological processes like in Mandarin Chinese or English to OMG
all my sentences are just 1 (or two, or three) complex words of the
poly-synthetic languages like Greenlandic, Navajo and what have you. And
everything in between this are on the scale somewhere. But 95 % of the language
are very very near to English on the scale, and very very far from Greenlandic.
Calling languages like French morphologically complex just because it has less
than ten more suffixes in one layer than English does is ludicrous. But I
digress, this is a collection of more or less accurate usages of
'morphologically complex' in published NLP articles.

This is also tongue-in-cheek, not meant to insult any of the authors, in no
particular order etc. etc.
